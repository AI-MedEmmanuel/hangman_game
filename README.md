# 🪓 Hangman Game

## 🧾 Description
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game built in Python. The player tries to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters within a limited number of chances (lives). With each wrong guess, a life is lost — guess all the letters before your lives run out!

## 💡 Concepts Used
- `random.choice()` for word selection
- Lists and string manipulation
- `while` loops and conditional logic
- Boolean flags (`found`) to track matches
- Functions and user input handling

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Run the program using Python.
2. The game will randomly select a word from a list.
3. Type in one letter per guess.
4. You have 6 lives. Each wrong guess costs 1 life.
5. If you guess all the letters before running out of lives — you win!

## 📸 Sample Output
Type a letter below
→ e
_ _ _ _ e _
Type a letter below
→ x
Your life = 5
Type a letter below
→ p
_ _ _ p e _
Type a letter below
→ r
_ r _ p e _

You win congratulations! 🎉
